
1.Prepare the vegetables. Steam or boil 1 medium beetroot and 2 small to medium potatoes in steamer or pressure cooker. If pressure cooking, then cook them with 1.5 to 2 cups water for 2 whistles.

2.Chop the cucumber, tomatoes and onions in thin round slices. Peel and slice the beet and potatoes thinly.

Make the chutney
3.Take 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ teaspoon cumin powder, 1 teaspoon chopped green chillies or serrano pepper (1 to 2 green chilies)and 1 to 2 chopped garlic cloves (small to medium-sized) in a chutney grinder jar or food processor.

Add and ½ to ¾ teaspoon lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon black salt and white salt or rock salt as required.

TIP: Love spicy foods? Me too! I usually add 2 to 3 green chilies as we prefer a spicier chutney in these grilled sandwiches. 

4.Grind the chutney ingredients till smooth. If you cannot grind, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water. I did not add water as there was enough moisture after rinsing the coriander leaves to help them grind to a smooth chutney.

5.Collect the coriander chutney in a bowl. Check the taste and add more salt if required. Cover and keep the chutney aside if you are making sandwiches immediately, otherwise cover and refrigerate.

TIP: Not much of a morning person? Feel free to prepare the vegetables and chutney the night before so that you can slap together the sandwiches with ease in the wee hours.

This sandwich will help you start your day off on the right foot, no matter how much of a night owl you are.

Assemble the sandwich
6.Using the bread slice of your choice (whole wheat, white or brown), spread a relatively liberal and even layer of butter on the inside slices of your bread.

TIP: This spreading of butter helps to create a barrier for the chutney so your bread doesn’t get soggy. Think of it like putting peanut butter on your bread before jelly.

Spread a thin layer of chutney over the butter.

7.On one slice, layer rounds of potato. Sprinkle with a pinch or two of chaat masala and roasted cumin powder.

8.Layer with tomato, onion, cucumber slices and beet slices (if using them). Add another pinch or two of chaat masala and roasted cumin powder, and finish with some black salt.

9.Top with your other slice of bread, chutney side in. Spread a thin layer of butter on the outside layer of the top bread slice.

TIP: Did you run out of butter? Not to worry. Spreading a thin layer of mayonnaise on the outside layer will result in just as beautiful grilled bread.

How to make grill sandwich
10.Preheat your grill. When warm, flip the sandwich so the butter side goes down. Butter the outside of the now top piece of bread.

11.Close the grill lid and grill for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden and crispy. 

12.Serve grilled sandwich hot or warm with a side of green chutney or tomato ketchup.
